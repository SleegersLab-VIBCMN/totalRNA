MissingOutputException in rule combine in file /home/jverwilt/JV2408_tear_RNA/code/Snakefile, line 2:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../output/20240906_AV242402_4843/A_DNase/01_reads/A_DNase_R1.fastq.gz (missing locally, parent dir contents: A_DNase_R1.fastq.gzcat, A_DNase_R2.fastq.gz)
Removing output files of failed job combine since they might be corrupted:
../output/20240906_AV242402_4843/A_DNase/01_reads/A_DNase_R2.fastq.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
